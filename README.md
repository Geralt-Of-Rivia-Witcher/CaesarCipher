## How to use:

**_Encrypt using one key -_** Put the text to be encrypted in a '.txt' file called "decrypted.txt" and put the file in the root folder. The key to use for encryption can be assigned to 'key' variable in line 37. Then run "CaesarCipher.java". The encrypted text will be placed in a file called "encrypted.txt".

**_Decrypt using one key -_** Put the text to be decrypted in a '.txt' file called "encrypted.txt" and put the file in the root folder. Then run "CaesarBreaker.java". The decrypted text will be placed in a file called "decrypted.txt".

**_Encrypt using two key -_** Put the text to be encrypted in a '.txt' file called "decrypted.txt" and put the file in the root folder. The key to use for encryption can be assigned to 'key1' and 'key2' variable in line 26 and 27. Then run "CaesarCipherTwoKey.java". The encrypted text will be placed in a file called "encrypted.txt".

**_Decrypt using two key -_** Put the text to be decrypted in a '.txt' file called "encrypted.txt" and put the file in the root folder. Then run "CaesarBreakerTwoKey.java". The decrypted text will be placed in a file called "decrypted.txt".
